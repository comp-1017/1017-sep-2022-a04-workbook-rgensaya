        <!--- the border="1" will add a default border around the table and each cell
            this is a known error . you may use this on yout tables -->
        <table border="1">
            <thead>
            <!-- the thead will indicate a line of column heathers
                the cell tag for this line will be <th>
                the contents of the cell will be bolded by default
            
                Optionally one can had their head titles on the rows
                here the developer uses the 1st column (general) as 
                the titles for the data
                if you are designing your table in this fashion then a
                thead area is not needed and the first cell on your tbody
                row will be a <th> cell

                    data think of a grid system (tabular)

                    see above for using <th> cell if you wish your
                    headings to appear on the row instead of the column top

                    by default, you are expected to have one <td> cell for
                    tags each <th> cell

                    <td> cells are grouped under a <tr> set of tags
                    <tr> is a table row
                    <td> is a data cell
