            if you wish to use a component of a reerved tag ( or the whole tag)
                you would be in trouble using the tag.

        <h3>Anchor tag (a.k.a linking to another page)</h3>
        <!-- blocked paired
            this is an anchor tag and is incorrectly often referred to as the 
                link tag
            one should NOT use the link tag because there is actually a <link>
                used in the ,head> section
            The anchor tag can take you to a different location whether it 
                be on a different website, different page in the current web site
                or a different location on the current page

            parameters:
            href: points to the desired location
            target: indicates the browser page display option
                default is same display page tag
                _blank will open a new browser tag (page)
        
        -->

        <h3>Image tag</h3>
        <!-- an empty (void) tag
            image tag does not have a closing tag
            the image has no content, however it does have parameters
            
            parameters
            src="relative web site location"
            alt="printable text if the image is not found at src"
            [title="tool tip text for the image"]

            Absolute adressing is a complete fixed file path
            drive:/folder/..../folder/filename.ext

            Relative address begins at a specific point
            for websites, it is the "top of the web site"
            reference to the desired filenameis done by specifying
            the appropriate folder path to the deired file
            NO DRIVE

            Movement with a relative address
            - if only the filename is given, the location is within the 
            same folder
            - movement down the file structure is by /foldername
            - movement up the file structure is by using .. for each 
            folder level to ascend
        
            same folder
             ="filename.ext"
        
             lower folder
             ="nextleveldownfoldername/nextleveldownfoldername/.../filename.ext"

             from one level folder to another lower folder on a different branch
            .. for each level that need to be ascended
             ="../../../nextleveldownfoldername/filename.ext"
